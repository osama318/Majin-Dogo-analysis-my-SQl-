MD Water Services SQL Analysis Project

A comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the md_water_services database to assess and improve water access across regions. This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills, including complex queries, joins, aggregations, CTEs, and data updates, to tackle real-world water service challenges. Key features include:

Cleaning and standardizing employee and water source data (e.g., email generation, phone number trimming).
Analyzing water source distribution, population served, and queue times by province, town, and type.
Ranking water sources for repair prioritization based on population impact.
Identifying discrepancies in water quality scores and employee performance.
Proposing infrastructure improvements (e.g., UV filters, well drilling) via a Project_progress table.
Technologies Used: SQL

Highlights:

Multi-table joins (INNER, LEFT) to combine employee, location, visits, and water quality data.
Aggregations and window functions (e.g., RANK, ROW_NUMBER) for prioritization and insights.
Time-based analysis of queue durations by day and hour.
Temporary tables and views for reusable, modular analysis.
Practical recommendations for water source upgrades based on contamination and usage data.
Dive into the code to explore how SQL can drive data-driven solutions for water access challenges
